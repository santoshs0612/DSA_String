Given a string S. For each index i(1<=i<=N-1), erase it if s[i] is equal to s[i-1] in the string.

Example 1:

Input:
S = aabb
Output:  ab 
Explanation: 'a' at 2nd position is
appearing 2nd time consecutively.
Similiar explanation for b at
4th position.

Example 2:

Input:
S = aabaa
Output:  aba
Explanation: 'a' at 2nd position is
appearing 2nd time consecutively.
'a' at fifth position is appearing
2nd time consecutively.

class Solution{
    public:
    string removeConsecutiveCharacter(string s)
    {
        // code here.
        int n= s.length();
        // base case
        if(n==0 || n==1)
        {
            return s;
        }
        
        // main case 
        if(s[0]==s[1])
        {
            int i=0;
            while(s[i]==s[0] && i<n)
            {
                i++;
            }
            return s[0]+removeConsecutiveCharacter(s.substr(i));
        }else 
        {
            return s[0]+removeConsecutiveCharacter(s.substr(1));
        }
    }
};
